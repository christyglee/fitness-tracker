## Coding Process

This application allows the user to:

* Add exercises to a previous workout plan

* Add new exercises to a new workout plan

* View the combined weight of multiple exercises on the `Dashboard` page

<br>

This application was created with:

* Mongo database and Mongoose schema to store data

* MongDB Atlas to host the database in the cloud

* Express NPM package to connect to servers

* Heroku - an application platform that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud
